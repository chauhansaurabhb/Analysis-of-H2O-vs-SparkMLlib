# Analysis-of-H2O-vs-SparkMLlib

The goal is to identify the state-of-the-art through the validation of benchmarking results on machine learning library on top of SparkR framework. For that, the experiment is performed on machine learning library of SparkMLlib and H2O (open source library from open source community) to prove the benchmarking results. The details of the experiment are available in the technical report along with the code.
