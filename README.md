# Analysis-of-H2O-vs-SparkMLlib

The goal is to identify the state-of-the-art through the validation of bench-marking results on machine learning library on top of SparkR framework. For that, the expriment is performed on machine learning library of SparkMLlib and H2O (open source library from open source community) to prove the bench-marking results. The detalis of the experiment is available in the technical report along with the code.
